        <h2>Alan Watts - Zen Master</h2>
        <p> Alan Watts was, among other things, a brilliant speaker and intellectual mind who came to prominence in the 1950s and '60s.  This was in part thanks to a series of popular radio talks given in San Francisco, the first entitled "The Great Books Of Asia" and the second "Way Beyond The West".  During his lifetime he wrote 25 books on philosophy, mysticism and religion.  Since his death in 1973 he has had another 40 published and his popularity has continued to grow through audio recordings on YouTube and Spotify.</p>
        <p>Alan Watts began his career as an Episcopal priest but found his parishioners to be more interested in cultivating a feeling of safety through repetition and tradition than genuinely looking to expand their consciousnesses. He left the priesthood in order to continue his studies without rocking the boat.</p>
        <p>Alan was also a man who had serious trouble with alcoholism which hastened his death.  He also had a penchant for sleeping with young college girls who attended his lectures which caused the end of his marriage.</p>
